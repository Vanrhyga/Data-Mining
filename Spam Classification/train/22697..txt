For the past 18 years around this time of year, I usually would be sitting in a classroom/lecture hall along with new faces, waiting for that yellow bus early in the morning, worrying about the type of grades I\'d be making in my new classes (i.e. calculating expected GPA for that semester), dreading on the amount of projected hours I\'d have to spend for this class or that, checking out the new wave of freshmen girls, catching up with friends and professors/advisors, checking out the new freshmen girls, and checking out the new buildings on campus.  Nowadays, its work 8-5 M-F and not doing all those things listed above, and more, just feels weird.  I kind of miss school...but not really..strange, mixed feeling this is.  Oh well, that just goes to show you that I\'m getting old.
Thinking of painting and decorating my room.  Any ideas on what color or theme I could go with?
Good Luck and Best Wishes to all of you with the new school year.
