Thanks .The 1st reason is enough.
     First of all, there are few foreigners here, Especially a white girl. And if your friend only want to improve her English, an native speaker would be enough. Why white? Is she racialistic?
     Secondly, why a foreign girl would like to talk with you with her native language? If she is here in China to teach English, it wont be for free. If she works or studies here, why wounldnt she practise her chinese but english?
     According to the reasons above, this msg wont work.
