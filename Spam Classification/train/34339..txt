        呃……把你想说的中文说一下……= =..
        我认为，
        最关键的一个错误是绝对不要用grin!!
        grin是那种很恶劣的笑，不是微笑的意思。也不是我们所谓的“坏笑”
     心情暂时不大好，不要开玩笑了，
     要发给她的，帮我好好改改，她名字已改过了
     （她不懂中文，所以要用英语）
     谢谢，对不起，忍不住鼻子酸酸的
     =======================
     Sorry Ms. mm,
     Sorry ah, it is my entire fault.  For a whole vacation hadn’t seen you,
     and suddenly found you were just shining in the cafeteria, made me had
     done such a silly thing.
     In many ways, I am a rational and comprehensive man (shyly to say polite
     currently [~), what can help me not force others must speak something out
     to hurt me.  I will stop and will never do that again.
     Thanks.  I always consider lovely girls asking me to help them on studies
     as doing me a favor.  Still very pleasing and thankful to the lovely grins
     and big-blinking eyes had seen in the library.  And always thought I
     should have done 10 times better to requite them and these chances that
     God gifted me.
     So if you have any difficulties in future, please feel free to let me have
     the lucky job again.
