you can only give your advice, you can not make decision for her even she is going down to the wrong way. 
She will come back when she realize it was a wrong decision, and she would appreciate that you were trying to help her. 
But if you keep arguing with her and trying to manipulate her, no doubt not only she will not follow your way , even worse she will find you more annoying and she will start to keep away from you. 
just let her go and support whatever she wants to do if you really like her.
well unless you are just being selfish and want her to be with you.
