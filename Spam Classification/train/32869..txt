     Database Log In Failed 
     TNS is unable to connect to destination. Invalid TNS address supplied or destination is not listening. This error can also occur because of underlying network transport problems. 
     Verify that the TNS name in the connectstring entry of the DAD for this URL is valid and the database listener is running.
