I feel so boring recently, don\'t wanna do anything, just sit before the computer and look like an idoit.
Actually I should\'ve been really busy. As a senior in college, I should seek for a decent job or prepare for TEM8, but I just dont wanna do anything but waste time.
Basically, I\'m a senior college student major in English, I\'m shiny,easy-going, humorous... yet sometimes in deep nights I feel lonely, and really need someone who can hear and share with my thoughts.
would you really like to be my friends?
When I\'m lonely, care for me;
When I have thoughts, share with you.
A friend lasts for ever.
would you really like to be my friends?
If so, do not hesitate to email me: nirayxu@gmail.com
