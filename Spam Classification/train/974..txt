        With Purchaser Playing key role more and more in the company in
   terms of cost driven, negotiation skill start to be major requirement
    on buyers recruitment and traning enhencement. Generally negotiation
      would account for >60% in buyer's time. Apparently it happens at
    supplier selection, new product introduction, engineering change and
   periodic cost down plan etc. At the hidden level negotiation exists at
               informal and formal discussion with suppliers.
