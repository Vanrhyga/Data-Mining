I have just the same feeling with U. In fact, I bet to say that there\'re also 
many people wandering around at the cross of the life. What\'s the value of
the life? Money, or power? Everyone will die. All is nothing after 100 years
to us. One should depend on himself, not others. In the past, what we seek for
is other\'s comment. There\'s something more valuable. What we do should make us
happy. Our own life should not be planned by others. 
Things above are really rubbish except for the opening sentence. I simply don\'t know what I\'m saying.
