Believe in your heart
No matter what the people might say.
The chance you take could take you to the top.
Listen up
You know you gotta throw your fear away.
Together we can make it
Shake it up baby.
[break]
[bridge:]
Hear the voices rock the nation
A calling to the skies I can see eternity is in your eyes.
[bridge:]
Come on everybody there’s a party to go to.
They’re holding out for you!
With every chance you take, a change you make.
The start of something new.
[chorus:]
All around the world they are singing
Calling to the beginning.
Oh oh oh celebrate our love, people with imagination.
Everywhere a celebration.
Oh oh oh celebrate our love!
Good to be free
Living out our own destiny.
The best will last forever
Never stop.
Gotta move
You know we gotta groove into the light.
Tonight will be the night that we’re breaking it up
Break it down baby.
[bridge]
[bridge]
[chorus:]
Oh oh, oh oh, na, na, na, na, na. oh oh, oh oh
Celebrate our love.
Let the rhythm take control
Feel the fire burn within your soul.
There’s a magic in your eyes
Forever we can take the music thru the night.
[repeat chorus: till end.] 
          一首叫做《Celebrate our love》的歌，爱尔兰帅哥四人组合A1的，越听越觉得适合放在LOVE版上，幸福的人嘛，权当celebrate自己的LOVE了；还没找着幸福的人嘛，就当作celebrate LOVE版吧。所以刚才偶想这么发文：“贴一首好听的歌，庆祝LOVE版开版X天！”可是发了好几条信版主也不告诉我X等于多少，那就只好就这样贴出来喽！
          歌词我没找着，大伙练练听力吧！^_^
          版主，我没有发表跟LOVE无关的话题吧，别封我哦！
