标  题: Visiting London, any luck to find a partner?
Samuel Johnson: "When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life."
Having been dreaming for a long time, I finally made up my schedule to visit London. Hope I could find a partner here. Thus I won\'t be traveling alone, and we can share our feelings about the capital of Europe.
If you are a fan of UK culture &amp; history; if you favor the city of London, Cambridge, Bath; or if you\'re only interested in a story, please don\'t hesitate to contact me.
My Temp Schedule:
Time: Sep 16th-25th
Dept: Hong Kong
Dest: London, Cambridge, Oxford, Bath, (Edinburgh, if time allowed)
