$85.3 million.
The Michael Bay-directed sci-fi thriller, which has taken in about $34 milli
on in its domestic run, joins "King Arthur" and "Kingdom of Heaven" among re

"The Island" topped the box office in France with $3.9 million, and also cam
e in first in Belgium, Denmark and Finland. After five weekends in South Kor
ea, "Island" remains strong with a market total of $20.5 million.
Both "The Island" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (which hurdled to 
$111.7 million after a $10.2 million weekend in 37 markets) have helped stim
ulate offshore activity in the past two months after a worrisome decline in 
the first half.
"Charlie" held first place in the U.K. for a fourth straight week, providing
 a market total of $52.6 million.
It was generally a mopping-up operation for most of the rest of the films cu
rrently making the overseas tour.
"Herbie: Fully Loaded" went up to $50.6 million after picking up $5.3 millio
n from 33 countries, marked by No. 1 bows in Norway and Malaysia and a No. 2
 start in Sweden.
"The Skeleton Key" tallied $4.9 million from 16 countries, boosted by a firs
t-place, $1.6 million opening in Germany, and a No. 1 bow on Australia with 
$1 million; its foreign total rose to $15.8 million.
"Wedding Crashers" toasted a $4.3 million weekend from 13 markets, lifting t
he international gross to $38.5 million.
"Bewitched" took in $3.7 million from 20 countries, highlighted by a No. 2 b
ow in the U.K..
"Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo" failed to impress in its early European ent
ry, taking just $314,000 in Germany.
"Sin City," with $5 million after two weekends in Germany and $3.8 million f
or the same period in Spain, hoisted its total to $65.7 million from 40 terr
itories.
The summer behemoths fattened their international cumes.
"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith," backed by a $5 million opening in Spain, raised it inter
national total to an estimated $207.1 million.
"Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith," with $72.3 million collecte
d in seven weeks in Japan, moved up to $454.7 million.
With a take of $2.5 million in its eighth weekend in 32 markets, "War of the
 Worlds" recorded a total of $338 million; "Madagascar" rose to $241.1 milli
